# Core Utils

**Objective:** To show my knowledge about the C language and its particularities.

This project is a collection of my own implementations of standard C library functions. I am building this to understand how things work under the hood.

## How to Run

You can compile the project using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc main.c -I./include -o main.out
./main.out
```

## Functions

### Math Utils
